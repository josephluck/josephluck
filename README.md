I'm a technical lead at Mettle, a start-up bank which is part Natwest. Day to day, I build customer-facing products on Mobile and Web, and help other engineers do the same. (I also like to build little side projects. You can find some of them here 👇)

I live in London with my girlfriend and Toy Poodle, Chester 🐩.
